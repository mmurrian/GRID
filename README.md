# GRID Software-defined GNSS Receiver

GRID is a sophisticated software-defined GNSS receiver created in C++ and SIMD-accelerated for both Intel and ARM architectures. It offers support for multiple constellations, frequencies, and antennas, making it well-suited for post-processing experimentation and analysis in academic research, as well as real-time, low-latency GNSS navigation on resource-limited general computing hardware. With over 15 years of continuous development, GRID has reached a high level of maturity.

Operating within the [Longhorn Dense Reference Network](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/denseNetworkIonPlans2016.pdf), GRID powers fixed reference stations, including solar-powered single-board computer-based units and survey-quality installations. Its scientific applications range from satellite-based atmospheric sounding to shipboard bathymetry. It has achieved many firsts in the world of GNSS:  It was the first GNSS SDR with built-in [spoofing detection](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/gnss_spoofing_detection.pdf), the first GNSS SDR to [operate in space](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/foton_2014_draft.pdf), and, since 2017, [on the International Space Station](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/leo_int_mon.pdf), the first receiver of any kind to show that [centimeter-accurate GNSS positioning is possible with a smartphone antenna](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/ion2014Pesyna.pdf), the first receiver to be used to [locate terrestrial sources of GNSS interference from low-Earth orbit](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/leo_int_mon.pdf), and is the basis of the [current state-of-the-art in urban RTK positioning](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/tight-coupling-journal.pdf).  GRID has also reaffirmed the commercial viability of GNSS SDR in widespread low-cost applications: it was recently licensed by a major aerospace company for use across all company operations, including in the thousands of satellites of the company's broadband Internet mega-constellation.

Tailored for and proven in RTK applications, GRID functions as both the base station and rover for static surveying, [lane-level vehicle navigation](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/tight-coupling-journal.pdf) in challenging urban environments ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7x_Rpe_bzw)), and [precision-flying drones](https://youtu.be/zW7SgIeaNmM). The software has also been utilized in innovative applications such as highly-precise signal direction-of-arrival sensors, custom two-way ranging/communication datalinks, and GNSS signal abnormality detection and monitoring.

A turnkey GNSS receiver based on GRID and a triple-frequency, dual-antenna RF front end can be purchased from [Locus Lock](https://locuslock.com/).  Locus Lock also offers licensing of the GRID binary executable.  GRID source code licensing is available for academic, commercial, or personal use, with negotiable terms through the University of Texas at Austin Office of Technology Commercialization.
