# GRID Software-defined GNSS Receiver

GRID is a software-defined GNSS receiver, developed in C++ and SIMD-accelerated for both Intel and ARM architectures. It supports multiple constellations, frequencies, and antennas. It is well suited for both post-processing experimentation and analysis in academic research, and real-time, low-latency GNSS navigation on resource-limited general computing hardware. It has been well-matured after 15 years of continuous development.

GRID operates fixed reference stations in the [Longhorn Dense Reference Network](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/denseNetworkIonPlans2016.pdf), including both solar-powered single-board computer-based units and survey-quality installations. GRID has existing applications in satellite-based atmospheric studies, both academic ([FOTON](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/joplin_itm_2012.pdf)) and commercial. Additionally, GRID is flying on several LEO satellites as the sole GNSS navigation sensor. It is tailored for and proven in RTK applications as both the base station and rover, for static survey, [lane-level vehicle navigation](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/humphreysPlans2018.pdf) even in challenging urban environments, and integrated in the control system for [precision-flying drones](https://youtu.be/zW7SgIeaNmM). GRID has seen use in other novel and unique applications such as a highly-precise signal direction-of-arrival sensor, as the receiver component of custom two-way ranging/communication datalinks, and in GNSS signal abnormality detection and monitoring.

GRID can be licensed for academic, commercial, or personal use with negotiable terms through the University of Texas at Austin Office of Technology Commercialization.
