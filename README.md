# GRID Software-defined GNSS Receiver

GRID is a sophisticated software-defined GNSS receiver, created in C++ and SIMD-accelerated for both Intel and ARM architectures. It offers support for multiple constellations, frequencies, and antennas, making it well-suited for post-processing experimentation and analysis in academic research, as well as real-time, low-latency GNSS navigation on resource-limited general computing hardware. With 15 years of continuous development, GRID has reached a high level of maturity.

Operating within the [Longhorn Dense Reference Network](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/denseNetworkIonPlans2016.pdf), GRID powers fixed reference stations, including solar-powered single-board computer-based units and survey-quality installations. Its existing applications span satellite-based atmospheric studies in both academic ([FOTON](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/joplin_itm_2012.pdf)) and commercial sectors. Moreover, GRID serves as the sole GNSS navigation sensor on several LEO satellites.

Tailored for and proven in RTK applications, GRID functions as both the base station and rover for static surveying, [lane-level vehicle navigation](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/images/stories/files/papers/humphreysPlans2018.pdf) in challenging urban environments, and [precision-flying drones](https://youtu.be/zW7SgIeaNmM). The software has also been utilized in innovative applications such as highly-precise signal direction-of-arrival sensors, custom two-way ranging/communication datalinks, and GNSS signal abnormality detection and monitoring.

GRID licensing is available for academic, commercial, or personal use, with negotiable terms through the University of Texas at Austin Office of Technology Commercialization.
